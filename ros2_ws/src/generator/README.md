# eduroam_can_interface

Install this into your ROS workspace to use the autogenerated functions in your project.

## Prerequisites

To autogenerate the files via python you need to install [cantools](https://cantools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

```cmd
pip install cantools
```

## Use as ROS package

In your *package.xml* file add the build dependecy.

```xml
<build_depend>eduroam_can_interface<build_depend>
```

In your CMakeLists.txt add these lines at the proper spot.

```CMake
find_package(eduroam_can_interface REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(TARGET <some packages> eduroam_can_interface)
```

After configuring you should be able to include the library using

```cpp
#include <eduroam_can_interface/can1_main_ft24.h>
```


Now build your workspace using 

```cmd
colcon build --symlink-install
```

Everything should work now and you can use the autogenerated c++ can library in your project.
